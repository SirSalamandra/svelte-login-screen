# Svelte Gamified Login Screen

Tired of boring, conventional login forms? This project reimagines the authentication experience as a fun, interactive mini-game.

Instead of simply typing your credentials, you must catch the correct letters and characters as they fall from the top of the screen. It's a test of attention and reflexes that provides a unique and memorable first impression for any application.
